Problem Statement
Engineering notebooks are legal documents engineers use to settle patent disputes, on-board engineers, and identify errors in the creation process. These documents are currently not digitized; therefore, they are difficult to share, format, search, and backup. Our software will allow the easy creation of digital documents that can also be used as a legal document by adding signature-like capabilities.


Project Objectives
* Allow engineers to increase time focused on their primary work by minimizing thought about formatting the engineering document or physically sharing the notebook.
* Make searching the notebook for past work or ideas easier.
* Ensure the client’s data is secure against cyber attacks and against data loss with end to end encryption.
   * Follows standards for patent process therefore validating the notebook.


Stakeholders
* Project Coordinators: Shreya Inamdar
* Software Developers: Killian Le Clainche, Jarett Lee, Aaron Neustedter, Chad Stucky, Ryan Sullivan, Mehul Patel
* Businesses
   * Businesses that employ many engineers
* Engineers
   * Engineers that use engineering notebooks


Deliverables
* Web Client
   * Allows the user to upload media and text to the web api and display the resulting document.
   * Allow the user to search the dates and titles of past documents.
   * Aids users in creating and formatting documents which adhere to the rules of engineering notebooks.
   * Users will not be able to edit pages after the end of a workday.
   * Review mode if time permits

   * Web API
   * REST/SOAP/other endpoints consume and create user owned documents (web, mobile, etc)
   * Backend will render and store the legal copy of page. This will not be editable.
   * Database
   * Contains pages and metadata that associates pages with notebooks
   * User management system
   * Data will be encrypted and protected as valuable Intellectual Property
   * Pages will have the ability to be digitally signed
   * Sign & co-sign, electronic signature
