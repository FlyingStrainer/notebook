# Start development
Main project located in /app/. Set /app/ as the main directory and run

```bash
npm install
git checkout -b <branch>
```

Where `<branch>` is the name of the feature you are adding.


If you are new to React apps, skim the app README to get a general idea how to contribute to the repository.

When pushing your commits to the repository, submit a pull request instead of pushing directly to master. Do this by running

```bash
git checkout master
git merge --no-ff <branch>
git push
```

This allows code to be reviewed before it is permanently added to the repo.
