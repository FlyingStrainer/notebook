Problem Statement
Engineering notebooks are legal documents engineers use to settle patent disputes, onboard new engineers, and identify errors in the creation process. These documents are not digital and are therefore difficult to share, format, search, and backup. Our software will allow engineers to easily create digital engineering notebooks that can also be used as legal documents in court.

Background Information


Problem details
Engineering notebooks are legal documents used primarily by engineers and are critical to settle patent disputes, inform engineers new to the project about the project, and identify error in the creation process.


Domain
This product would be used in the engineering domain. Almost all engineers are expected to keep notebooks documenting their work.


Targeted Users        
The target user of this product is an engineer or a manager for an engineering company. Engineers will use it to keep track of their work and managers will use it to measure progress. It can also be turned over to lawyers in the case of a legal dispute to prove inventorship of a product.


Similar Platforms and their Limitations
Currently, engineering notebooks are made by using physical notebooks with a strict set of rules. The intent is to keep the notebook secure against tampering and ensures it as a legal document. The physicality places the burden on the engineer to format and follow the strict guidelines. 
In less formal settings, websites and other digital mediums are used for convenience. Programs like OneNote/Evernote are software solutions to the engineering notebook. However, formatting, non editable page submissions, and user authenticated signatures are missing features that invalidate the documents legality. Other alternatives are built-in options for computer-aided design (CAD) software, such as PTC Mathcad or Autodesk Inventor, which are expensive and proprietary. Having a program with a single purpose allows us to keep the costs reasonable.
VENote aims to solve these problems and bring the engineering notebook virtual. It is dedicated to creating better engineering notebooks, faster. VENote intends to be collaborative and administer friendly allowing for small and large companies to manage and maintain as many engineering notebooks unlike any other current software solutions.
